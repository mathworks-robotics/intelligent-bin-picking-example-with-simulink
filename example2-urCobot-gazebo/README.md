An Intelligent Bin Picking application consists of a perception algorithm to detect objects and a motion planning algorithm that creates the trajectory path of the robot to pick up the object. First the positions and orientations of the objects lying in the bin are identified from the Camera images using Deep Learning based Image processing capability from Computer Vision Toolbox. The calculated pose is then passed to motion-planning algorithm as an input which plans the path and the trajectory is generated for the Cobot to pick the objects from the bin and place it. 
Using the [Robotics System Toolbox&trade; Support Package for Universal Robots UR Series Manipulators](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/117530-robotics-system-toolboxtm-support-package-for-universal-robots-ur-series-manipulators), you can establish ROS communication with Universal Robots manipulators and send the generated trajectory for the Cobot to pick up and place the objects at a destination location.This example is a Simulink based solution for the featured examples [Semi-Structured Intelligent Bin Picking for UR5e Using YOLO and PCA-Based Object Detection](https://in.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/urseries/ug/semi-structured-bin-picking-ur5e-yolo-pca-example.html) and [Gazebo Simulation of Semi-Structured Intelligent Bin Picking for UR5e Using YOLO and PCA-Based Object Detection](https://in.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/urseries/ug/gazebo-simulation-ur5e-semistructured-intelligent-bin-picking-example.html).

## Installation
Installation instructions

1. MATLAB installation: Visit installation instructions [webpage](https://in.mathworks.com/help/install/) to get started with the MATLAB installation process. 
2. Support package installation: Before proceeding, ensure that the products mentioned under MathWorks Products above are installed. To install the Robotics System Toolbox Support Package for Universal Robots UR Series Manipulators, follow the steps mentioned [here](https://in.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/urseries/ug/install-support-for-manipulator-hardware.html).  
3. Download ROS Virtual Machine For Pre-Installed Gazebo Environment: You can download a virtual machine image that already has ROS and Gazebo installed. This virtual machine is based on Ubuntu® Linux® and is pre-configured to support the examples in ROS Toolbox™. Download and install the ROS virtual machine from this [link](https://in.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/get-started-with-gazebo-and-a-simulated-turtlebot.html).
4. YOLO Object Detector MAT files and Dataset: The example uses a pre-trained YOLOV4 object detector for identifying the Cuboid objects. Download the detector MAT file from the following links.
- [Object detector and Dataset for Gazebo Simulation](https://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/UniversalRobots/IntelligentBinPickingDataSet/Cuboidal_Object_Dataset_Sim.zip)
- [Object detector and Dataset for UR5e Hardware](https://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/UniversalRobots/IntelligentBinPickingDataSet/Cuboidal_Object_Dataset_Real.zip)
